Welcome to **Notes**, a demonstration project created by Warren Anderson to implement [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org) using the **docs-as-code** philosophy. Sometimes referred to as docs-like-code.

The Node.js backend, Docsify documentation and Insomnia API Definitions file were created by Warren Anderson.

The Notes project is in separate GitHub repos.
