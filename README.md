Welcome to **Notes**, a demonstration project created by Warren Anderson to implement [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org) using the **docs-as-code** philosophy. Sometimes referred to as docs-like-code.

The Node.js backend, Docsify documentation and Insomnia API Definitions file were created by Warren Anderson.

The Notes project is in separate GitHub repos.

<!-- RELEASE # -->

As new versions of the documentation are created each will be in their own repo. The repo name will end with the version number.

This repo maintains the API Reference and other Doucmentation for the Notes project. The repo name contains the version of the documentation within.

All documentation for the Notes project is a set of markdown files rendered by Docisfy. You can find the source in **/docs** folder
